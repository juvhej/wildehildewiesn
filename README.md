This is a web page that plays sounds. Bavarian sounds often heard at the famous real Oktoberfest aka Wiesn in Munich. If you want to try the page download the whole folder. Note: Works best with firefox or chrome. Feel free to use the sounds and play with the code. But please be kind to the sounds, too. Thanks.
