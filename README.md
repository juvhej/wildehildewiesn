This is a web page that plays sounds. Bavarian sounds often heard at the famous real Oktoberfest aka Wiesn in Munich. If you want to try the page download the whole folder. Put exclamations, expressions, food, love and swearwords in one folder and name it audio. Note: Works best with firefox or chrome. Feel free to use the sounds and play with the code. But please be kind to the sounds, too. Thanks.
