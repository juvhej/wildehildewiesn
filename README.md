This is a web page that plays sounds. Bavarian sounds often heard at the famous real Oktoberfest aka Wiesn in Munich. If you want to use it download the whole folder. Note works best with firefox or chrome. Feel free to use the sounds and play with the code. But please be kind to the sounds, too. Thanks.
